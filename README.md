# TCGA_prostate_cancer_Gleason_score_CSLBP
TCGA prostate cancer Gleason score prediction using completed and statistical local binary patterns 

Matlab programs: implementation of our proposed method

Python programs: deep learning baseline method


In the init_upload, it contains matlab programs about our method made it during paper submission

In the 2nd_upload, it contains two folders:

TCGA_PRAD_Gleason_Score_Prediction_CSLBP -> matlab programs for our method and all intermediate results saved with .mat file

tcga_prad_tcbb_dl -> python programs for baseline deep learning models
